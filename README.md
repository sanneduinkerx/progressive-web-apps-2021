# Progressive Web Apps @cmda-minor-web · 20-21

In this course we will convert the client side web application previously made Web App From Scratch into a server side rendered application. We also add functionalities based on the Service Worker and turn the application into a Progressive Web App. Ultimately we are going to implement a series of optimisations to improve the performance of the application.  

### Week 1 - Server Side Rendering 📡

Goal: Render web pages server side

**TO DO LIST THIS WEEK:**
- [X] Get server up and running
- [ ] Use template engine ejs for node application
- [ ] Read into theory node.js and express, server side rendering
- [ ] Render in server side

**Plan of action:**
*How to get server up and running*
- download and install node.js - npm is included
- npm install and node install
- npm init -> make package.json 
- then npm install express --save -> to save to dependencies in package.json
- add to index.js file:

    '''
    // module imported express
    const express = require('express')

    const app = express()

    //port to listen to in browser
    const port = 3000

    // starting page, req -> request and a respond
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    //sends response to browser
    res.send('Hello World!!!')
    })

    app.listen(port, () => {
    // log in terminal with message that de web server is running
    console.log('Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}')
    })
    '''
- in command line node index.js or npm run start, to run web server 

<!-- Document in your readme.md how you will get the server up and running; git clone && npm start -->
